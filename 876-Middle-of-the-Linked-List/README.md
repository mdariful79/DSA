## Easy

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

#### Example 1:
![lc-midlist1](https://github.com/mdariful79/DSA/assets/59513154/958f6453-d599-4e7b-8a8b-29aac275cda5)
````
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
````
#### Example 2:
![lc-midlist2](https://github.com/mdariful79/DSA/assets/59513154/ef7eb136-3d7b-4981-8273-8edd5421dbde)

`````
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
`````

#### Constraints:
````
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
````
