# [100. Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-26)

## Easy

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.



#### Example 1:

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
````
#### Example 2:

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
`````
#### Example 3:

![image](https://github.com/mdariful79/DSA/assets/59513154/a07def59-2118-4108-9ec0-146e005ae114)

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
`````
#### Constraints:
````
The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
````
